# Data Analytics Power BI Report

In this project I:
- Performed ETL on a 120,000-record e-commerce data-set, extracting data
from Azure Storage and Azure SQL Database accounts into Power BI
- Transformed and cleaned data using Power Query to form a star-based
schema data model including a custom date table, and implemented 25 DAX
measures to support visualisations and time intelligence
- Created a 4-page report in Power BI containing 40 visualisations
- Constructed 5 SQL queries for the same data to generate insights for use
outside of the Power BI environment.
